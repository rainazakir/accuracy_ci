Supplementary material for paper "Miscommunication enhances the accuracy of consensus in robot swarms using cross-inhibition for decision-making"

The repo includes:

   *  Source of the Kilobot software for all the decision strategies used within the paper;
   *  The ARGoS simulation code (configuration file, robot control algorithm, Kilogrid Loop function and Kilogrid layout generation files).
   *  The code for Gillespie analysis
   *  The mathematical analysis (including the equation for bifurcation point in Mathematica)
   *  Some real robot demonstrations
